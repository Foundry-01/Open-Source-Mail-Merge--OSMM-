## Task: Refresh "Why OSMM" cards section (visual polish)

Goal
- Make the cards section feel cleaner and more modern
- Remove the gray background, improve spacing, and soften card styling

Context
- Current section uses `section alt section-cards` which gives a gray background
- Cards use an accent left bar; feels heavy compared to the rest of the page

Next step (broken down)
1) Remove gray background by dropping `alt` class in `src/pages/Home.tsx`
2) Refine card visuals in `src/styles/global.css`:
   - Subtle shadow, lighter border, hover lift, remove accent left bar
   - Maintain responsiveness and spacing
3) Rebuild and review visually
