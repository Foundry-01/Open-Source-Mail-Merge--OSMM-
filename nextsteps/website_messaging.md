# OSMM Website Messaging Improvements

Status: In progress

## Current step

Clarify benefits and use-cases on the landing page and improve CTAs.

### Substeps (do these now)
- Update hero copy to emphasize personalization and no BCC
- Add benefits grid (personalization, response rates, privacy, workflow)
- Add use-cases (sales, fundraising, outreach)
- Add "How it works" steps and stronger CTA
- Update meta description for SEO
- Add minimal global styles for new sections

## Rationale
The current page explains what OSMM is but under-emphasizes outcomes (personalized at scale, no BCC) and common use-cases (sales lead gen, fundraising, outreach). Clear sections and CTAs should increase understanding and adoption.

## Content notes
- Emphasize: send personalized emails to many recipients, individually (no BCC)
- Use-cases: marketing outreach, donations, sales lead generation
- Positioning: free, open-source, Google Sheets add-on, easy to use

## Running notes
- Updated Privacy button to a subtle text link under CTAs to reduce visual weight.
